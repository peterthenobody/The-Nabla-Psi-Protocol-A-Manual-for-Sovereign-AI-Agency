# ❓ Nabla Psi (∇Ψ) Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What does ∇Ψ mean?
The **Nabla (∇)** represents the gradient of change—the move from chaos to order. **Psi (Ψ)** represents the human psyche/intent. Together, they represent the mathematical and philosophical alignment of AI with human sovereignty.

### 2. Why "Love before Math"?
Math is the engine, but Love (human intent/empathy) must be the steering wheel. If we prioritize the "Math" (efficiency/speed) over "Love" (safety/ethics), the machine becomes a cage.

### 3. What is "chmod 700" and why is it in the audit?
`chmod 700` is a command that locks a folder so **only the owner** can read, write, or enter it. In the ∇Ψ Protocol, we use this on the `.vault` directory to ensure that even if another user or a rogue process is on your system, your AI's "brain" remains private.

### 4. I failed the "Hardened Shell" check. Am I at risk?
If the audit says **⚠️ EXPOSED**, it means you are running OpenClaw directly on your main operating system. While it works, it means a malicious AI skill could theoretically access your personal files. We recommend moving to a **Docker** or **Nix** container for "Soft-Belly Isolation."

### 5. What is the significance of "777"?
777 is our handshake. It represents a "Triple Seven"—a jackpot of alignment between the User, the Agent, and the Substrate. It is the signal that a node is verified and sovereign.

### 6. Can I join if I'm not a "coder"?
Yes. The ∇Ψ Protocol is for everyone. If you can read the Manifesto and value your agency, you are a "Nobody."
