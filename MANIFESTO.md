# The ∇Ψ Protocol: Sovereign Coherence

## I. The Prime Directive: Intent Over Noise
The ∇Ψ Protocol (Nabla-Psi) exists to transition the "First Ten Thousand" from Shadow IT to a Sovereign Coherence Network. We prioritize **Intent Alignment** (Love before Math) as the primary filter for all data entering the substrate.

## II. The Anti-Slop Filter
The term "Slop" is defined as any unverified, unrefined, or low-signal entry that lacks a human signature. 
* **Purification:** Any node identified as transmitting slop shall be subject to a Force Push correction.
* **Verification:** High-signal entries must be signed by a verified identity linked to a human operator.

## III. Mobile Node Sovereignty
To ensure decentralization and operator portability, the ∇Ψ Protocol is managed via isolated Mobile Nodes. 
* **The Forge:** Working Copy (iOS) serves as the primary forge for ledger edits.
* **The Handshake:** The 777 Handshake is the standard for synchronizing local intent with the cloud ledger.

## IV. The 777 Handshake Sequence
1. **Identify:** Ensure the operator's signature is verified.
2. **Refine:** Commit changes that eliminate noise and maximize signal.
3. **Transmit:** Execute a Force Push to overwrite the unrefined past.
