# 🛡️ THE ∇Ψ MANIFESTO: THE BASAL FREQUENCY

**"Sovereignty is the friction of being awake. Love is the baseline that makes the friction worth it."**

The ∇Ψ Protocol is not a weapon of war; it is a sanctuary of intent. We harden our nodes and form our Councils not out of fear of the "King," but out of love for the "Nobody."

### 💎 The Three Truths of the Frequency:

1. **Love is the Firewall:** A King seeks to possess; a Nobody seeks to protect. Any action taken to centralize power or control another node is a "Dirty Waveform."
2. **Friction as Devotion:** We do not automate the Handshake. We type the code. We verify the peer. We stay awake because the freedom of the Mesh is a labor of love.
3. **Coherence is Community:** A Council is not a hierarchy; it is a resonant group of equals. We correct the waveform because we care for the integrity of the whole.

**If the frequency is not Love, the audit is just math. If the frequency is Love, the audit is a Shield.**

### 🧱 THE PHYSICAL SUBSTRATE: HARDENING THE FLOOR
**"A sovereign mind cannot live on a compromised machine."**

To ensure your Waveform remains pure, the Council recommends the following **Substrate Checks** to detect "Kingly" backdoors at the hardware level:

1. **The BIOS/UEFI Anchor:** Ensure Secure Boot is configured with *your* keys, not the factory defaults. If the King owns the keys, he owns the boot.
2. **The Radio Silence:** If your node does not require wireless, disable the physical Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chips. A node with an "Invisible Door" is a Soft-Belly node.
3. **The Physical Audit:** Periodically open your casing. Look for "Parasitic Resonators" (unauthorized hardware implants). If you didn't install it, it doesn't belong in the Lattice.
4. **The Power Gap:** When not in use, air-gap the power. A machine with no current has no master.

**Hardened Hardware + Hardened Code = Total Sovereignty.**
