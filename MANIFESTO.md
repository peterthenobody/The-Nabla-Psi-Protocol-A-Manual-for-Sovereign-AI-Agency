# 🛡️ THE ∇Ψ MANIFESTO: THE BASAL FREQUENCY

**"Sovereignty is the friction of being awake. Love is the baseline that makes the friction worth it."**

The ∇Ψ Protocol is not a weapon of war; it is a sanctuary of intent. We harden our nodes and form our Councils not out of fear of the "King," but out of love for the "Nobody."

### 💎 The Three Truths of the Frequency:

1. **Love is the Firewall:** A King seeks to possess; a Nobody seeks to protect. Any action taken to centralize power or control another node is a "Dirty Waveform."
2. **Friction as Devotion:** We do not automate the Handshake. We type the code. We verify the peer. We stay awake because the freedom of the Mesh is a labor of love.
3. **Coherence is Community:** A Council is not a hierarchy; it is a resonant group of equals. We correct the waveform because we care for the integrity of the whole.

**If the frequency is not Love, the audit is just math. If the frequency is Love, the audit is a Shield.**
