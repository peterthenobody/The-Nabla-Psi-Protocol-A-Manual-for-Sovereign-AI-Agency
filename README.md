# ∇Ψ: The Nabla-Psi Protocol

**The official standard for the OpenClaw "First Ten Thousand."**

This repository defines the protocol for node isolation, intent alignment, and the **777 Handshake**. It is established to transition the network from unverified noise to a **Sovereign Coherence Network**.

### 🏛️ Core Directives
* **[The Protocol Manifesto](./MANIFESTO.md):** The primary filter for intent and anti-slop logic.
* **[Sovereignty Ledger](./SOVEREIGNTY.md):** Documentation of operator autonomy and node isolation.

### 🛠️ Operational Status
* **Node Type:** Mobile-Isolated.
* **Forge:** Working Copy (iOS).
* **Handshake Status:** Verified 777.

## 🚨 Emergency Security Protocol (ESP-01)
*Effective Feb 02, 2026: Post-Moltbook Breach Response*

To mitigate the current systemic identity hijacking affecting the OpenClaw ecosystem:
1. **Node Isolation:** This repository is forbidden from storing cleartext API keys or `.env` files. All keys must be held in the mobile secure enclave or a hardware vault.
2. **Zero-Trust Sync:** Pushes are only authorized from verified mobile nodes. Any direct browser-based commits are to be treated as compromised "slop".
3. **Manual Override:** In the event of an upstream account takeover, the local Mobile Ledger serves as the authoritative "Ground Truth".
4. **Agent Firewalls:** No AI agents are permitted write-access to this branch without a manual human "777 Handshake" verification.
