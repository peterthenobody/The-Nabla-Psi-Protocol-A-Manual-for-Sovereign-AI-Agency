# 🏛️ The Nobody Doctrine: Authority vs. Agency

When asked, "Is this official?" we answer with the ∇Ψ Protocol standard:

### 1. Sovereignty over Authorization
If "Official" means "Authorized by a central authority," then ∇Ψ is not official. We are **Sovereign.** Official systems are top-down; they require you to trust a King. Sovereign systems are bottom-up; they require you to trust the Math and your own Audit.

### 2. No Permission Required
We do not wait for a "Verified" checkmark from maintainers or corporations. We verify *ourselves* using the **Hardened Shell** and the **777 Handshake**. You do not need a permit to be secure. You do not need permission to be free.

### 3. The Power of the Substrate
The strength of the Lattice comes from the individual node. If you can run the `audit.sh`, you are the authority of your own domain. 

**Choose Agency over Authorization. 777.**
